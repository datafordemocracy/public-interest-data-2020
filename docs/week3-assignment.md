## Week 3 Assignment

### Part 1

Open the [week3-example.R file](https://github.com/datafordemocracy/public-interest-data-2020/blob/master/example-files/week3-example.R) and the [bestpractices.R](https://github.com/datafordemocracy/public-interest-data-2020/blob/master/example-files/bestpractices.R) file in R Studio. Mount the data in Veracrypt and read in the data. 

You'll use the same main variables as before, [variable assignments here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pOKLV4lXYs4Dyx3Gft959NhwY0FjkmN94rbZLMsI7Zc/edit?usp=sharing) but please feel free to use any other variables in the data to explore your variables in greater depth. *Note: if you have track as a variable, use track2 instead. *

Your script should contain at minimum 7 exploratory visualizations and 2 publication-ready visualizations (you only need to submit a PDF of one). Exploratory visualizations don't need aesthetically pleasing colors, renames axes, labels or annotations - these just give us a sense of what's in the data. The publication-ready visualizations should have labels, colors, annotations, descriptions and the like - everything you'd put into a chart going into the final report. 


### What to submit: 

* An R script with your visualization code with your assigned variables - come prepared to chat about what you found!
* A PDF of a publication ready graphic

Send these to the *assignments* channel on Slack by noon on Monday, March 16th.
