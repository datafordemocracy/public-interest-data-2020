## Lab Schedule

There are no books to purchase for this class. All readings are either freely available or will be shared on slack. For each week, you should complete the assigned reading before coming to class; these will frame our discussion and inform our work. There are three types of reading: (1) research about the child welfare system and racial disparity, (2) scholarship on data and methods, primarily with a focus on using data responsibly and ethically, (3) resources on using R, included as additional support, but not a focus of discussion. We will spend time in class -- about an hour each in weeks 1-3, and 30-45 minutes in weeks 4-7 -- demonstrating multiple ways of using R for our work.

### 2/17 The Child Welfare System, Learning by Doing, Data as Power

> For apart from inquiry apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry, human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other. - Paulo Freire, *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*

### 2/24 Local Context/Past Work, Understanding our Data, Data Provenance and Processing

> Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be
	concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an
	inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all
	indirectly. - Martin Luther King, Jr., *Letter from Birmingham Jail*
